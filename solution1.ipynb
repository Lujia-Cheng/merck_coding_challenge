    "# Question 1(a)\n",
    " \n",
    "1. PyPlate is a [Python package](https://pyplate-hte.readthedocs.io/en/working/index.html) for designing high-throughput chemistry and biology experiments. Suppose that you need to screen conditions for 12 cross-coupling reactions of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_i + B_i → C_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are starting materials, $C_i$ is a product, and i runs from 1…12. For each reaction, let $A_i$ be the limiting reagent (0.1 mmol), add 1.1 equivalents of $B_i$, 10 mol% $Pd(OAc)_2$, and 15 mol% of ligand (see below). (Equivalents are relative to limiting reagent.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) We’d like to screen a common set of 2 temperatures (60 ℃ and 80℃), 4 solvents (toluene, glyme, TBME, and dichloroethane), and 3 ligands (XPhos, SPhos, and dppf). Please write a PyPlate Recipe that implements the above experimental design. Use a total reaction volume of 200 uL and 96 well plates with a maximum volume of 500 uL. Use a random number generator with a fixed seed to set the molecular weights of $A_i$ and $B_i$ (set between 100 and 500 g/mol). Use the real molecular weights of everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, multiple experimental designs are possible here. Can you design a Recipe that is not only easy to code but also practical to carry out in the lab? What sort of practical considerations are there? Please provide your answer as a clearly documented Jupyter notebook. You should graphically illustrate your design. These diagrams should _not_ show the details of precisely what is in each well, but rather explain the concept behind the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that PyPlate does not currently have a feature to specify temperatures. You will have to keep track of that manually. As you go through this exercise, please read through the PyPlate documentation. If you notice anything that could be improved (and there a lot of possibilities), please email me. I will award significant extra credit for thoughtful, chemically sensible and computationally reasonable proposals along these lines."
